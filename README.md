# Better KeepInventory
 
This is a Datapack I wrote for Minecraft Survival. If you die, you get slowness II for 1 minute and loose 10 levels.
This makes it more balanced than just dying without loosing anything. Now you have to care about dying again. What a pity.
## How to install?

Glad you ask!

1. Download the newest release.
2. Go to your Minecraft saves folder.
3. Drop the .zip File in the datapacks Folder.
4. That's all! Now you can start up your world or just type /reload in chat.

### Multiplayer?
It still has to be tested but I assume that it works.
